Hi! My name is Viola. I'm a first year interactive media student.
My main interests are illustration and animation, but I'm giving my best shot at learning basic coding.
I've made some websites with Wix, but never coded or programmed anything before this web and app minor.
My biggest dream is to work on feature film projects for studios like Pixar or Dream Works.

As I am a complete beginner at this stuff, I know I'll be going quite slow and only doing the very basics.
But this first week went alright, and I look forwards to trying my best in the coming weeks.

Cheers! :-)
